# Predicting-Sales-through-ads-on-social-media---Ad-Analytics using KNN
Advertisement Analytics using Python
In simpler words we tell whether a user on Social Networking site after clicking the ad's displayed on the website,
end's up buying the product or not. This could be really helpful for the company selling the product.
Lets say that its a car company which has paid the social networking site(For simplicity we'll assume its Facebook from now on)
to display ads of its newly launched car.Now since the company relies heavily on the success of its newly launched car it would leave no stone unturned while trying to advertise the car.
whats better than advertising it on the most popular platform right now.But what if we only advertise it to the correct crowd.
This could help in boosting sales as we will be showing the ad of the car only to selected crowd.
So this is where the data scientist jump in ...
The Car company has hired you as a Data Scientist to find out the correct crowd, to which you need to advertise the car
and find out the people who are most likely to buy the car based on certain features which describe the type of users who have bought the car
previously by clicking on the ad.
